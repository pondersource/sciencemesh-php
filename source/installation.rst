Installation Guide
==================

The ScienceMesh-Nextcloud connection helps sites who run Nextcloud or ownCloud 10 as their enterprise file sync and share system to join the ScienceMesh.

For ownCloud 10 there is https://github.com/pondersource/oc-sciencemesh but the documentation is not complete yet.
For now, you can refer to some links in this Gitter thread:
https://gitter.im/sciencemesh/task-force-technical?at=630dc4aa9d3c186299d87893
and ask your questions there.

There are number of things you will need to do get this working for your site:

Enable dynamic share providers in Nextcloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Apply the `dynamic-shareproviders`_ branch to your Nextcloud installation.
This is necessary for Nextcloud to recognize shares of type the 'ScienceMesh'.

Install Revad
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See also https://github.com/cs3org/reva::

  git clone https://github.com/cs3org/reva
  cd reva
  make deps
  make build

Configure revad
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Something like `./mesh.toml`. This will probably require some experimentation. You can contact @michielbdejong in https://gitter.im/cs3org/REVA for help.
See also the `ocm-test-suite revad configs`_ for examples.

Install the ScienceMesh app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In your Nextcloud apps folder, run::

  git clone https://github.com/pondersource/nc-sciencemesh sciencemesh

Enable the app in the Nextcloud admin dashboard.
This will cause a few necessary database tables to be created.


First use
~~~~~~~~~
From there on, follow the `admin guide`_.
